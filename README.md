NXT-lichtverfolger--light-follower-
===================================

Lego Mindstorm Robot follows the light.
I made this programm myself as i studied Mechatronik at University of Applied Science Saarbr√ºcken.
User has to calibrate the light intensity and define the Threshold, that the programm use to differentiate
the light intensity of the environment and the light source to follow. I wrote this code as i started to learn programming.

I hope this can be helpful for many people on our lovely earth. Thank you =)
