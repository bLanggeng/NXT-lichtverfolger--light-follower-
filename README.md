NXT-lichtverfolger--light-follower-
===================================

Lego Mindstorm Robot follow the light.
I made this programm myself as i studied Mechatronik at University of Applied Science Saarbr√ºcken.
User have to calibrate the lightintensity and define the Threshold, that the programm use to differentiate
the lightintensity of the environment and the light source to follow. I wrote this code as i started to learn programming.
